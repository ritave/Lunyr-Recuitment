# Lunyr Recruitment Challenge

## What is this
This is a solution to the Solidty recruitment challenge posed by Lunyr.
The initial challenge can be found in the `Challenge.sol` file, while the 
solution exists in `contracts/Shareholders.sol`. The goal was to fix the bugs,
security mistakes and generally explain what the Smart-Contract ought o do.

I've decided that the best way to achieve this task is to, alongside with git log,
is to keep a journal of my decisions and their explanations in this README.

## Running
All the commands are found as npm scripts. The minimum to run tests would be:

    npm install
    npm run test

## Journal
1. Decided to use Truffle for compilation and testing
  * Preferably I would use somehting lighter for this task,
    but Dapple is deprecated, Dapp is not yet ready and Embark
    is even bigger than Truffle
  * TODO: Create my own open-source light skeleton for Smart-Contract
    development?
